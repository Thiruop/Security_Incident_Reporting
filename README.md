**Overview**

The **Security Incident Reporting Application** is a system designed to assist employees in reporting system-related issues within their organization. Employees can submit detailed reports describing the problems they face. Once a report is submitted, the system automatically sends an email notification to the admin team, ensuring they are alerted in real-time.

Admins can log into the system to view and manage all incoming reports. They can update the status of each report **Open, Under Review, or Resolved** and add notes to keep the employee informed throughout the resolution process. Employees can track the status of their reported issues directly from their dashboard.

Both Employees and Admins have access to **role-specific dashboards** that provide a clear overview of all incidents based on their status. The system also includes **user activity tracking** so that admins can monitor login status, submitted reports, and interactions.

Additionally, the application includes a **filter option**, allowing users to easily sort and view reports based on categories, status improving usability and efficiency in managing large volumes of incident reports.
